# AtTiny25 Thermostat

This is the source package for my ATTiny25 based digital thermostat. 
It'll require that you've installed gcc-avr and binutils, as well as avrdude for programming the chip with the firmware.
To build the project, run `make main.hex` and to program the chip via a USBTinyISP (http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/index.html) run `make program`.
